Date: 2025-03-17
  Major Features:
    - Initial release
    - Added Space Age compatiblity
    - Instead of satellites, in Space Age, cats are required to pilot space platforms
    - Cats can only be lured on surfaces with at least a little atmosphere

  Changes:
    - Ported https://mods.factorio.com/mod/petcat to Factorio 2.0
    - Easter egg is now optional (default: enabled)
    - Cross-mod support has been left in, though none of the supported mods have updated to 2.0, so it is untested

  Known Issues:
    - Cat-Player collisions cannot be disabled, and the setting has been removed
    - The Easter egg can be used in more places than intended, making it overpowered
